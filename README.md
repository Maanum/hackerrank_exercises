# Hackerank Exercises

This repo stores select Hackerrank submissions.  Jupyter Notebook used for most solutions as this format:

1. Can provide full problem context as given by Hackerrank
2. Diplays syntax-highlighted code and results for easy readability
3. Is supported by Github to display properly in the browser

Each test/submission should be fully encapsulated in a single notebook (with links as appropriate).
